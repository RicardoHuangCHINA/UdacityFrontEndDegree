1. I know how to create new tags: <h1>,<img>,<figure>,<li>,<buttom>. Knowing how to set the local path to the image.
2. Most of them are easy, so far so good.
3. Some concept learning, like relative path, first I didn't read the notes carefully, when I do the quiz, I set the image source wrong.
4. Pretty good. Like I metioned in question4. I went through the problem solving steps. review the notes that I missed, then I easily find the way out.
